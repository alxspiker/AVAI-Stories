# AVAI-Stories
Stories written by AVAI

AVAI stands for AVanced AI. This is a repo for global collaboration on AI generated stories.

The goal is to improve the stories and add whatever touch you would like.

I am not sure how I will manage what gets in the story or not because obviously we don't want trolls ruining this, but basically if it makes sense and works, Ill accept the change, maybe even propose a change to you and see what you think, but ultimately its up to you.

Feel free to edit, revise, or start your own and get your name in the credits of the stories you helped with.

Naming scheme:
* __summary.md - The general plot of the story to help contributors stay on focus of the story. Maybe sort the plot based on chapters
* 0_prologue.md - Provide some background details that set the scene for the story thatâ€™s about to unfold
* 1_chapter_name - A number indicating the chapter number and the name, this will obviously contain the text for that chapter.
