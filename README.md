## Repository Information
AVAI stands for Advanced AI, and this repository serves as a hub for global collaboration on AI-generated stories. Our goal is to continuously improve these stories and allow contributors to add their personal touch.

### Contribution Guidelines
- Feel free to edit, revise, or even start your own story within this repository.
- If youâ€™d like to contribute, follow the naming scheme below:

#### Naming Scheme:
- __summary.md: This file provides the general plot of the story, helping contributors stay focused on the narrative. You can also sort the plot based on chapters.
- 0_prologue.md: Here, provide background details that set the scene for the unfolding story.
- 1_chapter_name.md: Each chapter is numbered and named accordingly. The content of each chapter resides in its corresponding file.

Remember that while Iâ€™ll accept sensible changes, we want to avoid trolls ruining this collaborative effort. Ultimately, decisions on what gets included in the story will be up to you as the contributor. Your name will be credited in the stories you help enhance!

Feel free to explore, create, and let your imagination run wild! ðŸ“šðŸ¤–
