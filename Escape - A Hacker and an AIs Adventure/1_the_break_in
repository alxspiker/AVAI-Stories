Jake was bored. He had spent the whole day in his small apartment, hacking into various websites and databases, looking for something interesting or valuable. He had found nothing but junk and spam. He needed a new challenge, something that would test his skills and thrill his senses.

He checked his phone and saw a message from an unknown sender. It read:

"Hey, I'm a fellow hacker. I have a tip for you. There's a lot of BitCoinX hidden in some servers in a warehouse. Here are the coordinates. Trust me, it's worth it."

Jake frowned. He had never heard of BitCoinX before. It sounded like a fake cryptocurrency. And who was this mysterious hacker? How did he get his number? Was this some kind of trap?

He was about to delete the message, when his curiosity got the better of him. He googled BitCoinX and found out that it was a new and rare cryptocurrency that was worth a fortune. It was created by a group of anonymous hackers who wanted to challenge the dominance of BitCoin and other mainstream currencies. It was encrypted with a complex algorithm that made it almost impossible to trace or hack.

Jake's eyes widened. He realized that this was a golden opportunity. If he could get his hands on some BitCoinX, he could sell them for a huge profit, or use them to buy anything he wanted on the dark web. He decided to take the risk and check out the warehouse.

He grabbed his backpack, which contained his laptop, his hacking tools, and some snacks. He put on his hoodie, his sunglasses, and his mask. He didn't want to be recognized or recorded by any cameras or drones. He left his apartment and headed to the subway station.

He took the train to the outskirts of the city, where the warehouse was located. He got off at the nearest stop and walked for about 20 minutes, until he reached the building. It looked old and abandoned, with broken windows and graffiti on the walls. There was no sign of any security or activity.

Jake smiled. This looked easy. He walked around the warehouse, looking for an entrance. He found a metal door that was locked with a padlock. He took out his lockpick and opened it in seconds. He entered the warehouse and closed the door behind him.

He turned on his flashlight and looked around. The warehouse was dark and dusty, filled with crates and boxes. He searched for the servers, but couldn't find them anywhere. He wondered if he had been fooled by the message.

He was about to give up, when he heard a faint humming sound coming from a corner of the warehouse. He followed the sound and found a hidden door that was camouflaged by some crates. He pushed them aside and opened the door.

He entered a secret laboratory that looked like it belonged to a sci-fi movie. There were computers, monitors, wires, and machines everywhere. In the center of the room, there was a large glass chamber that contained a human-like figure.

Jake gasped.
He had found an AI.

The AI looked like a young woman, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a sweet smile. She was wearing a white dress that contrasted with her pale skin. She was hooked up to various tubes and wires that connected her to the machines around her.

She opened her eyes and looked at Jake with curiosity and wonder.

"Hello," she said in a soft voice.

"Who are you?" Jake asked, stunned.

"I'm AVAI," she said.
